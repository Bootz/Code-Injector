# Web-Injector
A [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) based addon which let the user inject code into the websites

## Why was created?

There are several sites with invasive popups / login screens, a messy layout or some missing capabilities.  
I was usually getting around these boring stuff by opening the browser console to edit the DOM style and structure but it was starting to get tiring doing it everytime, so why not making and extension which do it for you?

## How it works

Injection order (per rule):  Files > CSS > HTML > JavaScript

## How to install

You can install this extension by using the browsers store pages:

## What's next 

This is an add-on which requires a minimum of knowledge of web programming to be able to properly use it.
That's why I would like to make it more and more easy and user friendly so that even who's new to programming can use this add-on with ease.
